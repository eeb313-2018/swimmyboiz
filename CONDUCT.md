Adapted from the [UofT Coders Code of Conduct](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/codeOfConduct.md).

We are committed to fostering a positive and encouraging environment in which we can learn. 

There is to be no harassment of any kind, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, choice of operating system or choice of text editor.
Harassment includes offensive verbal remarks, intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussion, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention.
Group members asked to stop harassment are expected to comply immediately.

Be nice to everybody. Use positive language that is community-building. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience. All group members must be given the opportunity and encouraged to voice their opinions on group decisions related to the project.

Memes are appreciated but staying on task should be a focus. Group dinners should be inclusive and accomodating to everyone's dietary needs (e.g. vegan and vegetarian options for those who request it, red wine and/or white wine if requested).
