# Study objectives

- What water chemistry factors influence benthic invertebrate diversity in lakes, specifically EPT?
- What physical properties influence benthic invertebrate diversity in lakes, specifically EPT?
- Are there anthropogenic factors that have resulted in a change in benthic invertebrate diversity in lakes, specifically EPT?
- Are there other factors that have resulted in the difference in EPT diversity between lakes?
