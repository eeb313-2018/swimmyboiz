#Introduction to the project
Our project is concerning the EPT concentration in lakes related to different environmental variables such as pH levels, conductivity and temperature. EPT (Ephemoptera, Plectoptera and Trichoptera) are benthic invertebrates which are commonly used as bioindicators in order to assess the aqautic health of freshbodies of water. The goal of this project is to assess the diversity of EPT in each of the lake datasets (taken from the same year), and compare how healthy their ecosystems are, based on the different envirnonmental variables investigated (pH, temperature, conductivity depth, DO and oxygen levels). This is important as anthropogenic impacts on aquatic ecosystems have been detrimental recently, therefore analysing the health of these invertebrates will help determine the quality of the water, this is often done for waters near industrial factories to see if they're vailating the law.


#Description of the data
The variables that are within the dataset are depth, lat and long, oxygen, pH, temperature, EPT_NIND, EPT_NTAX, EPT_PIND, EPT_PTAX, Year and Site. Where: EPT_NIND <- number of EPT individuals in sample EPT_NTAX <- number of EPT taxa EPT_PIND < percent ept individuals EPT_PTAX <- percent ept taxa

Data collection: The water quality measurments (ecological variables) transparency, DO, pH, temperature and conductivity were measure using a multi parameter water quality meter/sonde. DO was measured using a probe in the field against an atmospheric standard set by manufcturer's specifications. pH measure with pH meter at each site. Conductivity was measured prior to sampling each site adn as well as after the day was complete. Each of these variables were then measured at diffrerent water depths (0.5m, 1m, 5m, 10m) and recorded. For data collection on the benthic imvertebrates, sediment was collected and sieved through a 0.5m sieve in order to isolate the organisms found. The organisms were then placed in sample jar for preservation till in the lab.
